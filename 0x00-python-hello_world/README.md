Project Repository README
Description
This repository contains Python scripts, Shell scripts, and C scripts developed to meet specific requirements. The project is organized according to the guidelines provided below.

Python Scripts
All Python scripts are written to be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
The scripts are created with allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
Each Python script file ends with a new line.
The first line of each Python script is #!/usr/bin/python3.
There is a README.md file at the root of the repository providing an overview of the project.
Shell Scripts
All Shell scripts are designed to be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Each Shell script is exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2).
The Shell script files end with a new line.
The first line of each Shell script is #!/bin/bash.
All Shell script files are executable.
C Scripts
All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
The C scripts adhere to the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
Each C file ends with a new line.
The code follows the guidelines of no global variables and no more than 5 functions per file.
The prototypes of all functions are included in the header file lists.h.
Header files are include guarded to prevent multiple inclusions.
General Requirements
The project follows the code style specified by pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
All files, including scripts and headers, are executable.
The length of files is tested using wc.

# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## General
This repository contains solutions for tasks related to JavaScript warm-up, covering various fundamental concepts and functionalities.

### Why JavaScript programming is amazing
JavaScript is amazing due to its versatility, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Its ability to run on both client and server sides makes it an essential language for modern web development.

### How to run a JavaScript script
To run a JavaScript script, you can use the Node.js runtime environment. Simply execute `node script.js` in your terminal, where `script.js` is the name of your JavaScript file.

### How to create variables and constants
Variables in JavaScript can be created using `var`, `const`, or `let` keywords. `var` is function-scoped, `let` is block-scoped, and `const` creates a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.

### What are differences between var, const and let
- `var`: Function-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
- `let`: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared.
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or updated after initialization.

### What are all the data types available in JavaScript
JavaScript supports various data types including:
- Primitive types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
- Object types: object

### How to use the if, if ... else statements
The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The `if...else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

### How to use comments
JavaScript supports single-line comments `//` and multi-line comments `/* */` to add explanations or notes within the code.

### How to affect values to variables
Values can be assigned to variables using the assignment operator `=`. For example: `let x = 10;`

### How to use while and for loops
- `while` loop executes a block of code while a specified condition is true.
- `for` loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

### How to use break and continue statements
`break` statement terminates the current loop, while `continue` statement jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

### What is a function and how do you use functions
A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions in JavaScript can be declared using the `function` keyword, and they can accept parameters and return values.

### What does a function that does not use any return statement return
A function that does not use any return statement implicitly returns `undefined`.

### Scope of variables
Variables in JavaScript have either function scope (if declared with `var`) or block scope (if declared with `let` or `const`). Function scope means the variable is visible within the function it was declared, while block scope means the variable is visible only within the block it was declared.

### What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
JavaScript supports arithmetic operators such as `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus), `++` (increment), and `--` (decrement).

### How to manipulate dictionary
In JavaScript, a dictionary is usually represented as an object. You can manipulate it by adding, updating, or deleting key-value pairs using dot notation or bracket notation.

### How to import a file
In Node.js, you can import a file using the `require` or `import` statement, depending on the module system being used.

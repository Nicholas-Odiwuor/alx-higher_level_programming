# 0x11. Python - Network #1

This repository contains solutions to tasks related to network programming in Python. The tasks are part of the 0x11 project in the Holberton School's curriculum.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use `get()` to access dictionary values by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
- Documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
- Code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
